# 🌐 My First Website

This is my very first website project created as part of a university web systems course.  
It's a simple static website built with **HTML** and **CSS**, and it features my favorite places and things in Sydney 🇦🇺🐶.

> 📁 Project Folder: `WebSystemProject`

## 📌 About the Project

This website was designed purely for learning and fun.  
It includes:

- ✅ A **main page** (`mainpage.html`)
- 📍 A page for my **favorite place** in Sydney (`fav-place.html`)
- 🐾 A page for my **favorite thing** — dogs! (`fav-thing.html`)
- 🎨 Custom CSS styling in `a2.css`
- 🖼️ Embedded local images for visual presentation

## 🚀 How to View

Simply open the `mainpage.html` file in any modern web browser like Chrome, Edge, or Firefox.  
No additional setup or server is needed — this is a static website!

- This was my **first time learning HTML & CSS**, so the code may be simple and experimental.
- I plan to keep this as a milestone for how I started with front-end development.
- Feedback is always welcome! 🙌
